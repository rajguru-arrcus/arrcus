IFMGR. -- Vijay
    * Min links behavior: [prasanna and CE team to define the behavior]
      * When added wait for transition to UP ?
        RFC talks only about Disable egress.
      * When session becomes down because peer is down
      * Session is down when peer is deleted.
      * When session is deleted because LACP or Link is down.

    * IPv4 & IPv6 forwarding. -- Today
      * Disable egress when any AF is down.
        UP only if both AF is up.
      * Code review comments from last time.
      * Code cleanup.
    * Linux patch to remove the printk dint work.

BFD: -- Ashutosh/Raj/Vijay/Kalyani.
  * BFD code reorg.
    * DEMUX in BFD session.
    * based on current implementation how much restructuring has to be done.
  * BFD states definition in bfd_micro_host.c.
  * BFD VLAN 0 parsing in the software receive path.

DPAL: -- Vijay/Raj.
  * Validate the imapact of INGRESS disable for software path on xgs and DNX.
    * Cint validation.
      * Check control plane & Data plane.
      * Bond cint - https://github.com/vijayr-arrcus/arrcus/blob/master/lag/cint_j2/adv_trunk.c
  * impact of the list changes in XGS. -- Dont care for now.

TILFA: -- Csaba.
  * identify micro bfd session in session state change callback.
  * handle session state change and link state change.
    * link state change happens first and we wait for 150 * 3 ms for session state change.
  * Multiple link failure handling.
  * Hierarchical BFD [out of scope ?]
    * Micro down translates to Macro BFD down.
    * Link state down + min links translate to MACRO bfd down ?
  * What is the default for XR(cisco)

Vijay/Prasanna:
  * Unit test plan.
  * Solution test.
  * Scale.

Mayur & Prasanna.
  * Automation - Micro BFD.
  * Behavior of cisco under various conditions.
    * BFD and interface states.
  * Normal BFD regression status ?
