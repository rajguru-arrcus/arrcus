===============
To DPAL -- egress interface -- ifindex of the port.

Port is used to program the NH.

gport of trunk is used to program the NH.

removed from the trunk group in the hardware.

802.3ad mode
		IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation.  Creates
		aggregation groups that share the same speed and
		duplex settings.  Utilizes all slaves in the active
		aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.
		Slave selection for outgoing traffic is done according
		to the transmit hash policy, which may be changed from
		the default simple XOR policy via the xmit_hash_policy
		option, documented below.  Note that not all transmit
		policies may be 802.3ad compliant, particularly in
		regards to the packet mis-ordering requirements of
		section 43.2.4 of the 802.3ad standard.  Differing
		peer implementations will have varying tolerances for
		noncompliance.
		Prerequisites:
		1. Ethtool support in the base drivers for retrieving
		the speed and duplex of each slave.
		2. A switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link
		aggregation.
		Most switches will require some type of configuration
		to enable 802.3ad mode.


    	balance-xor

    		XOR policy: Transmit based on the selected transmit
    		hash policy.  The default policy is a simple [(source
    		MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address XOR
    		packet type ID) modulo slave count].  Alternate transmit
    		policies may be	selected via the xmit_hash_policy option,
    		described below.
