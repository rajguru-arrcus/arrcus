LAG on J2 Design review

High level architecture over view of LAG on J2
==============================================
   i. Control plane
   ii. LACP integration
   iii. GLOBAL ID integration
   iv. DPAL DNX and J2 layer

Key design decisions.
===================
  i.  GLOBAL ID
  ii. Port to Gport -- Including programming for NH.
  iii.QOS ingress/egress - Programmable mapping and filtering.
  iv. Sflow changes.
  v. Policer
  vi. No association of a member link with a lag until all configs are removed.
  vii. Mixed speed member links ?
  viii. QOS on subinterface not supported yet.

Convergence
============
  i.   Make before break -- during update
  ii.  Hashing algorithm used to resolve link when one member link goes down.
  iii. Micro BFD vs BFD.
  iv. LACP fast timers

Scale
=====
  i. 256 LAG groups with 64 member links each
  ii. Multi unit scenario -- medusa case.
  iii. config reload scenario.
  iv. Scale for QOS, policer

Telemetry
==========
  i. Interface counters currently
  ii. No MIB support for LAG exists even for XGS.

Programmable mapping and filter.
