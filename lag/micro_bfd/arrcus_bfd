If the HAL full offload DOWN session is programmed into the hardware.
Session entry already has if_index but is used for link local IPv6 address while creating source port.

bfd_host_session_update_state -- update internal states

session_info.if_index = decoded_obj.if_index;  if_index is if_index for link local address.



Packet on an interface corresponds to the BFD session for that interface.
What happens if there is not session on that interface ?
