a.	Configuration.
config
  bfd profile GLOBAL
    micro source ipv4 address <address>

  interface bond20
    bfd micro
      enable true
      destination ipv4 address <address>
      source ipv4 address <address>
      min-links <num>

show bfd micro interface bond20
b.	Support of min links for micro BFD -- > bond interface will go down once bfd active member links is less than configured.
This could be different or same from min-links of LACP. For now the two min-links configurations are being kept different.
c.	Initially we had concluded that if the session corresponding to any of the AF is down, the member link will be marked down and removed from LB table.
Since we are checking connectivity of the member links, is it required to support sessions for both AF ?, can we stick to only IPV4 sessions ?
d.	Is this required for XGS family of switches as well ?, this is being planned only for DNX J2 for now.
e.	The RFC 7130, suggest that the initial protocol packets be sent with a dedicated multicast destination MAC and optionally move to the actual destination MAC.
We intend to have an implementation where all destination will be for a dedicated multicast MAC address.
f.	Once BFD declares the link as inactive, LACP will still be enabled on the link and will timeout as per its own timers.
BFD timeout will not impact LACP states.
