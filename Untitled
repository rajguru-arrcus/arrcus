a. BFD session to be created on a member link

      LINK_STATE oper UP, ADMIN_UP -- physical member link.
      BOND_STATE ADMIN_UP
  BOND_MODE == LACP
      LACP is ACTIVE
      LACP is distributing.
      ADDRESSES are configured.
        local-address
        remote-address

      if_index -- member link
      bond_if_index -- bond
      peer ip
      local ip


      Session cleanup
        BFD_ADMIN_DOWN --



Remote...

    doing a deletion of the session same on the remote ---  ADMIN DOWN --- should we reset the session.
    as time out of the session on the local.           ---  DOWN       --- should we reset the session.

INIT, DOWN, ADMIN DOWN UP

DOWN -- FWD_State = 1(UP)

old_fwd != new_fwd then we set.

DOWN_UP   --- FWD_state = 1  -- remove from egress disable.
UP_DOWN   --- FWD_state = 0  -- add to egress disable.

min links - 2
curr up link - 2
no member aggregate on the member link -- curr_up link 1 -- bond is down.
member aggregate -- curr up link 2 -- bond is up.

BFD

min link - 2 (local)
curr up link - 2 (local)
no member aggregate (remote) -- ADMIN DOWN -- curr up link 2 -- bond

after BFD makes a transition to UP and then !up we renegotiate everything.

a. LACP down, link state down -- delete session -- send to peer that my local state is DOWN.
b. no micro bfd or no member aggregate or bfd global disable -- delete session -- but send to peer that my local state is ADMIN down.
c. Upon timeout or local link down -- delete session -- but peer should be perceived down.
d. bond admin down -- delete all session -- should this be perceived as local DOWN or ADMIN DOWN ? -- LACP considers this down
e. session is created only if LACP is UP, link is up, and bond is admin up -- but this is perceived as ADMIN down by the peer.
f. Incase of no member aggregate -- LACP will perceive that this link is down but BFD will perceive that the link is ADMIN DOWN.
   So potentially BFD will not bring down the interface but LACP might.
   Need to verify the behavior with Cisco, but this will not easy to check.


This is assuming that session came up once.  ** what if we did a no on the remote.

Further if local BFD is admin down -- I am assuming that peer will be notified as ADMIN DOWN as well irrespective of what was its recent state.
